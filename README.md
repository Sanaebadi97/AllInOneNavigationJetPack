***__The Navigation Architecture Component__***

Navigating between ```activities``` and/or ```fragments``` has never been easy.
Now, with the Navigation library and the ```navigation``` viewer built into Android Studio, 
you can visually design how your screens are connected to one another.
Many people have noticed that this is similar to
Storyboards in Apple’s Interface Builder for iOS app development.
Using Navigation, you visually connect one screen to another using “destinations”.
You create a navigation graph that will have a starting destination that
can have actions to go to other destinations. 
The great thing about this is that you can define animations in the visual editor.
The library even handles deep linking into your app. 
Passing data between destinations can be done in a safe way with a new plugin called safeargs. 
You can define what arguments the Fragments in the 
```navigation graph``` accept from within the navigation file itself.

and use lottie library for animation too ;)
